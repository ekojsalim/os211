# Top 10 List of Week 07

This list is written in no particular order :)

## 1. [Real World Haskell - Software transactional memory](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/software-transactional-memory.html)
Haskell always fascinates me as a good language for concurrent programming and I got introduced to a new concept by reading this Haskell Resource.
This links to a chapter on a Haskell book describing about software transactional memory and how it can become an alternative to lock based approach to synchronization.

## 2. [Contrasting Peterson’s and Dekker’s algorithms](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/12621/contrasting-peterson-s-and-dekker-s-algorithms)
This links to a useful explanation about the difference between these two algorithms with historical context (which I always like :)).

## 3. [Race Conditions and How to Prevent Them - A Look at Dekker's Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqnpIwN7dz0)
This links to a Youtube video explaining about Dekker's Algorithm (complete with pretty cute animations).

## 4. [Transactional Memory vs Mutex and Locks](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/218683/transactional-memory-vs-mutex-and-locks)
Back to transactional memory, this links to a discussion on what is really the difference between transactional memory based approach and locks based approach to synchronization.

## 5. [Introduction to Lock-Free Data Structures with Java Examples](https://www.baeldung.com/lock-free-programming)
This links to a fun introduction to Lock-Free Data Structure in Java. I think that this is a pretty good resource to get familiar with non-blocking algorithms and lock-free data strucutres.

## 6. [The Dining Philosophers Problem](https://pages.mtu.edu/~shene/NSF-3/e-Book/MUTEX/TM-example-philos-1.html)
This links to an explanation to The Dining Philosophers Problem which I found useful to understand the problem.

## 7. [What is “Linearizability”?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9762101/what-is-linearizability)
I stumbled upon the concept of "linearizability" when googling about concurrent programming. This links to a useful question and answer thread that explains about the concept.

## 8. [What is “non-blocking” concurrency and how is it different than normal concurrency?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2824225/what-is-non-blocking-concurrency-and-how-is-it-different-than-normal-concurren/8918074)
This links to a question and answer thread that discusses how non-blocking conccurency is different than 'normal' (blocking) conccurency.

## 9. [Banker's Algorithm in Operating System](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/bankers-algorithm)
This links to a useful site that helps me understand the Banker's Algorithm.

## 10. [How The First Ever Telecoms Scam Worked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPeVsniB7b0)
Very much only tangentially related but when thinking about semaphore, this video came to mind. This links to a Youtube video by Tom Scott explaining the first ever telecom scam, which actually involves semaphore towers.
