# Top 10 List of Week 03

This list is written in no particular order :)
<sub><sup>btw kak, ternyata saya kegocek format quiz 2 minggu berturut-turut :(</sup></sub>

## 1. [Recommended Partitioning Scheme](https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/amd64/apcs03.html.en)

This links to Debian's recommendation for partitioning. This does not directly relates to this week lesson but this is something that every Linux user encounter when they setup their system.

## 2. [A Linux user's guide to Logical Volume Management](https://opensource.com/business/16/9/linux-users-guide-lvm)

When I was doing GSGS on how to expand my Linux partition safely, I came across this term LVM. This link is a pretty thorough explanation on what LVM is and what it can do.

## 3. [Space Maps](https://blogs.oracle.com/bonwick/space-maps)

This links illustrates what exactly is a space map. It also covers the problem of keeping track free space.

## 4. [Optimizing NFS Performance](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/NFS-HOWTO/performance.html)

NFS performance can be real slow. This links list common steps to optimize and debug NFS performance.

## 5. [astrada/google-drive-ocamlfuse](https://github.com/astrada/google-drive-ocamlfuse)

This links to a github repository containing an implementation of FUSE filesytem over Google Drive. It is really interesting what we can do with FUSE and this repo is one such practical use.

## 6. [Anatomy of the Linux virtual file system switch](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/linux/tutorials/l-virtual-filesystem-switch/)

This link really helps me to understand VFS. It explains all the major concepts and abstractions in VFS (Superblock, Directory Entry, etc.)

## 7. [sshfs](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs)

This links to a github repository containing SSHFS. SSHFS allows the mounting of a remote filesystem using SFTP and since most SSH servers enable SFTP by default, sshfs is indeed very convenient sometimes.

## 8. [Zero Size Files - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiTTAbeqQKY)

This Computerphile video explains why we can have '0' bytes file even though we have all these metadata about the file.

## 9. [What is tmpfs](https://www.jamescoyle.net/knowledge/1659-what-is-tmpfs)

This link explains what is tmpfs. Basically, tmpfs is a file system that keeps all its file in virtual memory (volatile) :O

## 10. [Differences between /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/sbin](https://askubuntu.com/questions/308045/differences-between-bin-sbin-usr-bin-usr-sbin-usr-local-bin-usr-local)

This links to a stackoverflow discussion on what the different folder for binaries represents.
