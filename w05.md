## 1. [Will ‘Htop’ Replace Default ‘Top’ Monitoring Tool in Linux?](https://www.tecmint.com/htop-vs-top-in-linux/)

I was curious as to the difference between top and htop as I have only used htop before and I didn't know that top is the basis for htop. This links to an article explaining the differences between top and htop.

## 2. [Why has CPU frequency ceased to grow?](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/blogs/why-has-cpu-frequency-ceased-to-grow.html)

This links to an explanation by Intel detailing why CPU Frequency is pretty much stagnant. Multi-core is pretty much the future of computing.

## 3. [Copy on Write in Operating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3hPGyd8vwk)

This links to a Youtube video detailing what is Copy on Write and what is it useful for.

## 4. [Allocation of frames in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)

This links to an article explaining frame allocation in operating systems. It explains Frame Allocation algorithms and local vs global frame allocation.

## 5. [What is the minimum amount of RAM required to run Linux?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-minimum-amount-of-RAM-required-to-run-Linux)

Related to this week's assignment, I was pretty curious on what is the absolute minimum amount of RAM that is required to run a modern Linux Distro. This links to a question-answer thread that discusses the afromentioned issue.

## 6. [Writing Dirty Pages to Disk](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/understanding-the-linux/0596005652/ch15s03.html)

Talking about Linux and Operating Systems resource usage, Alpine Linux is a pretty popular Linux Distribution in the Docker community. I was wondering how Alpine Linux has such a tiny footprint(4 MB :O) and this article explains it.

## 8. [Will More RAM Make your PC Faster?? (2020)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUFWalEf31w)

This links to a YouTube video by LinusTechTips which illustrates whether more ram is more better :v.

## 9. [Lessons in Managing Haskell Memory](https://tech.channable.com/posts/2020-04-07-lessons-in-managing-haskell-memory.html)

This is a blog post explaining how to manage memory in Haskell effectively. It is an interesting read to get a sense of how memory management could work in a functional programming environment.

## 10. [The microarchitecture of Intel, AMD, and VIA CPUs?](https://www.agner.org/optimize/microarchitecture.pdf)

This links to a lengthy and hefty PDF explaining the microarchitecutre of various CPUS. I was just casually browsing about branch prediction and was curious about the implementation in modern processors.
