# Top 10 List of Week 08

This list is written in no particular order :)

## 1. [Linux From Scratch on EC2](https://czep.net/17/lfs-on-ec2.html)
This links to a blog post discussing how to build a Linux From Scratch image for AWS EC2.

## 2. [Difference between gawk vs. awk](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/29576/difference-between-gawk-vs-awk)
It turns out that Gawk is an implementation of awk and when we call `awk`, we may call Gawk. This links to a discussion thread discussing the 'difference' between Gawk and awk.

## 3. [Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive Scheduling: Key Differences](https://www.guru99.com/preemptive-vs-non-preemptive-scheduling.html)
This links to an explanation as to the difference of Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling.

## 4. [Create a C program that takes the longest period of time to compile in gcc](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/8882/create-a-c-program-that-takes-the-longest-period-of-time-to-compile-in-gcc)
This is a (fun) link to a challenge/discussion thread to create a c program that will take a long time to compile.

## 5. [Dynamic Binary Translation -- A Model-Driven Approach](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6694090)
When searching about virtualization, I stumbled upon the concept of Dynamic Binary Translation. This links to a paper explaining Dynamic Binary Translation in good detail.

## 6. [Algorithms Lesson 6: Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta Notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ol2JbwoJp0)
Given that this week touches on Big O notation, this links to a youtube video I found useful in explaining the different notations used to describe complexity.

## 7. [A Comparative Study of CPU Scheduling Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.4165.pdf)
This links to a paper comparing the different scheduling algorithms (SJF is the fastest hmm).

## 8. [What is GLIBC? What is it used for?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11460782/what-is-glibc-what-is-it-used-for)
This links to a discussion thread discussing about glibc (GNU C Library). I was pretty curious about it given the long compile time it has.

## 9. [From Nand to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)
Given that this week we started on Linux From Scratch, I was reminded of this cool project/course. This links to the course page of 'From Nand to Tetris', a course of building and OS from scratch (boolean arithmetics).

## 10. [There's Plenty Moore Room: IBM's New 2nm CPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ0yfEnwipo)
This links to a Youtube video discussing IBM new 2 nanometer process for creating CPU. Very interesting watch, the presenter gives good informations about the various different process nodes and how they differ.
