# Top 10 List of Week 02
This list is written in no particular order :)

## 1. [How often should I rotate my ssh keys?](https://tailscale.com/blog/rotate-ssh-keys/)
This links to a blog post that illustrates the importance of (ssh) key rotation.

## 2. [Why aren't we using SHA-3?](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3256088/why-arent-we-using-sha3.html)
SHA-1 is very old at this point and most vendors are stopping to accept it. SHA-3 is the successor to SHA-2 which itself is the successor to SHA-1. This link explains why arent SHA-3 common now.

## 3. ["C" Programming Language: Brian Kernighan - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de2Hsvxaf8M)
This links to a Computerphile Youtube video with Prof. Brian Kernighan which tells the story how he came to write the K&R book.

## 4. [algo](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo)
This links to a github repo of a script collection that simplify the setup of a VPN. This really simplifies the steps to have our own secure VPN.

## 5. [Difference between PGP, OpenPGP, And GnuPG](https://blog.ipswitch.com/the-difference-between-pgp-openpgp-and-gnupg-encryption)
I was confused about  'pgp' and 'gpg' and this blog post explains a lot on how it all came to be.

## 6. [How Quantum Computers Break Encryption | Shor's Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvTqbM5Dq4Q&vl=en)
This is a link to the a chapter of the online Pro Git Book by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub. This chapter describes the use of git submodules, that is a git repository as a subdirectory of another git repository. Git submodules are pretty interesting, they can be use in multitudes of way such as automatically updating relevant libraries or making a central repo for deployments.

## 7. [Google Chrome blocking third-party cookies](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox)
Google Chrome is finally blocking third-party cookies. This is really a good step forward for a more private internet.

## 8. [JSON Web Key](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517/)
This may be only tangentially related to the current topic but JSON Web Key is a pretty nifty standard that now underpins a good chunk of authentication on the web given that many websites are now using JSON Web Tokens.

## 9. [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/)
Hardware authentication devices are interesting things and I have always wanted one. They are really necessary for truly secure systems.

## 10. [The C Programming Language](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Kernighan-C-Programming-Language-2nd-Edition/PGM54487.html)
It is simply a sin to not include K&R when discussing C references. Therefore, the above links to a listing for the book, the OG book for C.
