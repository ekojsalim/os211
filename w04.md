# Top 10 List of Week 04

This list is written in no particular order :)

## 1. [Endianness Explained With an Egg - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcaiHcBvDR4)

This links to a Computerphile video explaining endianness. It is really interesting to know that a fiction book called Guilliver's Travel influenced the naming of such concepts.

## 2. [Why use pointers?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/162941/why-use-pointers)

This links to stackoverflow thread regarding pointers and why do we use them. It's really an interesting perspective on pointers.

## 3. [Essentials: Pointer Power! - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5NszbIerYc)

This links to a Computerphile video explaining about pointers. Well, this video explains a the concept in an easy-to-follow and basic way.

## 4. [PE and ELF Code Caves](https://medium.com/cyber-unbound/pe-and-elf-code-caves-32bb06635d27)

This is a pretty deep dive into PE and ELF format for executables and specifically the code cave portion. I will be first to admit that most of this article went over my head but it seems to be a very interesting read.

## 5. [Is a statically linked executable faster than a dynamically linked executable?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4667882/is-a-statically-linked-executable-faster-than-a-dynamically-linked-executable)

It turns out that statically linked executables' speed differences comapred to a dynamically linked one are basically imperceptible. This links to a thread that discusses the performance difference of such executables.

## 6. [Ten process injection techniques](https://www.elastic.co/blog/ten-process-injection-techniques-technical-survey-common-and-trending-process)

Not directly related to this week topic but given that we are talking about memory, I always found code injection to be pretty fascinating. This links to a technical survey of common process injection techniques.

## 7. [Do we really need swap on modern systems?](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/do-we-really-need-swap-modern-systems)

This links to a pretty interesting article/discussion by RedHat on the importance (or lack of now) of swap in modern systems.

## 8. [Learn Makefiles](https://makefiletutorial.com/)

This links to a pretty engaging tutorial for Makefile with interesting illustrations and code.

## 9. [Simple Algebraic Data Types](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2015/01/13/simple-algebraic-data-types/)

Well, I can't resist linking this in. This is more of a discussion on Haskell's type system rather than discussion on struct or C in general, but given that Haskell's type system is simply that awesome, I can't resist linking this.

## 10. [What is the main difference between integer pointer and character pointer?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18171654)

This links to a stackoverflow answer that is a pretty succinct elucidation on how endianness can affect pointers.
